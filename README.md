Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

# About the project 

In this Project We have created a Movie Trailer Website.
In order to do this I have created two files 
1. media.py
2. Entertainment_center.py

In _"Entertainment_center.py"_ file, a constructor "media.Movie" is called and list of six movies "DDLJ", "taare zameen par", "ice age", "kung fu panda", "madagaskar" and " I am legend" is called with instances which includes respective "Movie Title", "Storyline", " Poster image" and "Youtube trailer links". Hence movie objects are instantiated. Movies list is stored in a list and "open_movies_page" function is called which takes these movies as input in order to build the HTML file.

In _"media.py"_, a class called Movie() is created where the properties of the movie "movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube" are encapsulated. From the "Entertainment_center.py" file this constructor is called in order to open the list of movies "DDLJ", "taare zameen par", "ice age", " kung fu panda", "madagaskar" and "I am legend" as a HTML page.

The "fresh_tomatoes.py" file contains a "open_movies_page" function. It takes the list of movies as input and gives the output as the website that shows those movies. 

__Output:__ " On Clicking the poster image of the movie in the "fresh_tomatoes.html" the youtube trailer of the movie is displayed.
